"""Site rules for the IEEG portal's annotation export.

The export is one row per annotation-channel pair, which is how
ts_annotation_time_series stores the link. Two things have to happen before it
is an annotation stream:

**Squash.** A mark on 68 channels arrives as 68 rows carrying the same
ts_annotation_id, timestamp and text. They are one annotation with 68 channels,
not 68 annotations.

**Dedupe.** The same Natus ENT file imported three times leaves three
ts_annotation rows per mark, with different ids and create times but the same
timestamp and text. Written through, a viewer draws each mark three times on
top of itself.

The imports are not always identical. On the measured HUP247 export one of the
three copies linked 60 channels rather than 68, dropping RY04 upward from one
electrode. So collapsing them to a single mark means choosing which channels
survive, which is why the default does not choose: copies that differ are all
kept. A mark drawn twice is visible and fixable; an electrode that quietly
vanished from an annotation is neither.
